- normalize all coordinates on model creation such that all values are in range 
  of [0, 1].
- add option to move camera
- small rasterization bug in the triangle fill. 
	- artifacts are visible in statue .obj file
	- generally clean this up a big it seems uneeded to have 2 functions that 
	  are that similar.
- we could greatly improve the speed of this...
	- larger files cannot be renderered reliably at the moment
	- maybe try some perf testing???
