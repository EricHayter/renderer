- we could greatly improve the speed of this...
	- larger files cannot be renderered reliably at the moment
	- maybe try some perf testing???
- renderer object could use some refactoring its just got a bunch of junk in it

- normal parsing
- finish off drawing model
- get the formatting right on the code it's all over the place
