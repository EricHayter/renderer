	- larger files cannot be renderered reliably at the moment
	- maybe try some perf testing???
- renderer object could use some refactoring its just got a bunch of junk in it

- finish off drawing model
- get the formatting right on the code it's all over the place

- use bilinear interpolation for phong shading

- first setup stuff required for adjusting normal values
	- inverse matries
	- adj matricies
- organize these files holly smokes Eric
